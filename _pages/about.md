I received the B.S. degree from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2016, the M.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2019, and the Ph.D. degree in information and communications engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2023. My current research interests include AI-native air interface, RIS, and massive MIMO. My achievements were selected as one of the Top 10 Science and Technology Progress in the Information and Communication field for 2022 in China. I were the recipient of the First Prize from Natural Science of the Chinese Institute of Electronics and the 2023 Chinese Institute of Electronics Best Doctoral Thesis Award.
